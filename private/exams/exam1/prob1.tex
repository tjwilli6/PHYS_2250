\question At a certain point in space, a point charge with a charge  of  \Qone{} experiences a force\\ $\vec{F}$=\Fone.
\begin{parts}
	\part What is the electric field vector $\efield$ responsible for this force?
	\vspace{4cm}
	\part The original \Qone{} charge is removed and replaced with another point charge with a charge of\\ \Qtwo. What is the force $\vec{F}$ (both magnitude and direction) experienced by this new charge?
	\vspace{4cm}
	\part You find that the charge responsible for this electric field is a point charge with a charge of \Qthree. How far away is this charge from the point where $\efield$ was measured?
