\question At a certain point in space, a point charge with a charge of $+5\ \mu$C experiences a force $\vec{F}=<-1,2,0>$ N due to the presence of an electric field.

\begin{parts}
	\part What is the electric field vector $\vec{E}$ responsible for this force? Express your result as a vector with appropriate units.

	\part The original $+5\ \mu$C charge is now removed and replaced with another point charge with a charge of $-2\ \mu$C. What is the force $\vec{F}$ experienced by this charge? Express your result as a vector with appropriate units.
