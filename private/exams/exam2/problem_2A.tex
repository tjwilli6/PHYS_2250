\question A 3 V battery is short-circuited (connected to a circuit with zero resistance), and the current is found to be \current. Now, an uncharged capacitor with a capacitance of \capacitor{} is connected to the same battery. How much time will it take for the capacitor to reach 50\% of its final charge?
