				\textit{\large \textbf{Instructions}: You have until 11:59 PM on Wednesday to submit your exam. Please answer only one problem per page, and clearly label which problem you are working on. The exam must be submitted on Canvas as a single PDF via a scanner, or a smart-phone scanner app. Partial credit may be awarded, so you are encouraged to clearly and legibly show your work for each problem.

			\textit{\large \textbf{Academic Integrity}: The exam is open-book and open-note, but you are not allowed to discuss anything on the exam with your classmates (until after Wednesday night). Evidence of collaboration with classmates constitutes a violation of the University's academic honesty policy and may result in the complete forfeiture of your exam grade. This applies if you receive help from others or if you provide help to others}}}}
